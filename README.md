# etch-a-sketch
Etchasketch project created for the Web Development 101 track on theodinproject.com. 

The goal was to create a small paint application using a grid of <divs>. The original goal was just to be able to pass the mouse over the grid of divs and have each one change it's color. The grid needed to be dynamic. A user should be able to clear the screen and set up a new grid, and start over with a grid of any number of boxes. Those boxes were to always be put in the same size "canvas".

See the attached files for my project. My son saw what I was doing and asked me to include the mousedown events to see if you're clicking the mouse so it actually acts more like a paint program.

Features example code for:
--

-Creating large changes to the DOM.
-Mousedown/mouseup/click
-Good use of functions
-Modifying opacity based on what it currently is ( so, go up or down )
